# Sachet - Transparency Platform for Nepali Governance

A modern, citizen-centric prototype designed to bridge the trust gap between the government and the people of Nepal.

## 🚀 Purpose
**Sachet** is built with a single mission: to make governance transparent and accessible. In a post-GenZ protest landscape, the demand for accountability in Nepal has never been higher. This platform empowers citizens by:
- **Tracking Budgets**: Real-time visualization of how public funds are allocated.
- **Monitoring Projects**: Status updates on infrastructure and local development.
- **Simplified Laws**: Breaking down complex legal documents into easy-to-read summaries.
- **Anonymous Reporting**: A secure, encrypted way for citizens to report corruption without fear of retaliation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (Vite)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Interactivity**: Lucide React (Icons), Radix UI (Components)
- **Data & Maps**: Leaflet.js (Geospatial tracking), Chart.js (Budget analytics)
- **Animations**: CSS3 Keyframes & Transitions

## 🇳🇵 Why This Matters for Nepal
Nepal is at a turning point. Following the powerful GenZ-led protests, there is a clear mandate for a "Transparent Government" (Sunischit Shasan). Citizens are no longer satisfied with opaque processes. **Sachet** serves as a digital watchdog, ensuring that transparency isn't just a promise, but a functional reality. By giving every Nepali citizen the tools to watch over public spending and project execution, we move closer to the country we all deserve.
